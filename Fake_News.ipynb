Back in 2008, John Paul Jackson released a DVD entitled \\u201c The Perfect Storm \\u201d in which he detailed many of the prophetic events that God showed him would soon come to America. In 2012, he released a video update to \\u201cThe Perfect Storm\\u201d that you can view on YouTube right here . In that update, he shared a list of future headlines that God had revealed to him over the years. Some of these headlines have already happened since that time, and now we are watching another be fulfilled right in front of our eyes. \\nSpecifically, I am referring to this headline: \\u201cRecord High Temps Accompany Record Drought Swept South\\u201d . \\nIn an article entitled \\u201c July\\u2019s Extreme Heat Breaks Records Across South \\u201c, weather.com detailed many of the high temperature records that have been broken in the South in recent months, but in this article I am going to focus on the crippling drought that is plaguing the region. \\nIn addition to the headline above, John Paul Jackson was shown several other headlines regarding drought and famine coming to America\\u2026 \\n\\u201cDrought Continues to Cause Prayer to Rise\\u201d \\n\\u201cDemand for Classic Seeds Skyrockets\\u201d \\n\\u201cFood Prices Lead Nation\\u2019s Escalating Inflation Woes\\u201d \\n\\u201cSysco and Kraft Consider Guards on Delivery Trucks as Food Nears 40% of the Family Budget\\u201d \\nAnd of course John Paul Jackson is not the only one that has been shown that these things are coming to this nation. \\nThe following is a very small portion of what Terry Bennett was shown in April 2011 \\u2026 \\nI was also warned, by the appearing of the black horse and its rider, about famine. The angel said, \\u201cThere will be a famine of food in your nation!\\u201d Not only this, but also the prices of food, particularly grains, will dramatically rise. We will see not only shortages and high prices, but I was shown significant starvation occurring during this time. Death followed this black horse! \\nDr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories of Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and she was also shown that famine is going to hit America \\u2026 \\n\\u201cI\\u2019m instructing my children to begin to fill up their storehouses before the famine strikes just as I instructed Joseph while he was in Egypt.\\u201d \\nWith those prophecies in mind, it is extremely alarming to see what is happening all across the southern portion of the United States right now. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor , most of the southern half of the country is experiencing some level of drought at this moment\\u2026 \\nThe drought in California has been raging for quite some time, but what has surprised the experts is how dry it has been in the Southeast lately. The following is from an EcoWatch article entitled \\u201c Record-Breaking Drought and Wildfires Plague Southeast \\u201c\\u2026 \\nThe atmospheric spigots have been turned off across most of the U.S. over the last several weeks. According to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor report from Nov. 10, more than 27 percent of the contiguous U.S. has been enveloped by at least moderate drought (categories D1 through D4). This is the largest percentage value in more than a year, since late October 2015 . \\nThe upward trend of the last month is worrisome given the outlook for the coming winter: Drier-than-average conditions are projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration across the southern half of the contiguous U.S., a frequent outcome during La Ni\\u00f1a winters. \\nTo say that the drought in the Southeast is severe would be a tremendous understatement. At this point, some cities in the Southeast haven\\u2019t seen any measurable rain in about 50 days \\u2026 \\nNo measurable rain (at least .01 inches) has been tallied at Birmingham\\u2019s Shuttlesworth International Airport since Sept. 18, approaching a two-month-long dry streak, topping their previous longest dry streak on record \\u2013 52 straight days \\u2013 from fall 1924. \\nNine minutes of sprinkles Nov. 4 and another bout of sprinkles on Oct. 16 has been the entirety of Birmingham\\u2019s rainfall so far this fall. \\nAnniston, Alabama, and Rome, Georgia, have dry streaks now approaching 50 days. \\nAnd unfortunately, it appears that there is not going to be any substantial rain for the region any time soon \\u2026 \\nThere are no signs of any significant rainfall through the end of the month across the Southeast, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity said. \\nThe region needs days and weeks of a steady, soaking rain to completely eliminate the drought. \\n\\u201cThings will only get worse before they get better,\\u201d Margusity explained. \\nWhenever conditions are this dry, it is inevitable that there will be wildfires. \\nRight now more than 100 major wildfires are raging across the Southeast, and some of the worst are in the mountains of North Carolina. \\nAs you read this article, more than 1,000 firefighters are battling dozens of large wildfires in the North Carolina mountains. Governor Pat McCrory is referring to these fires as \\u201c California wildfires in North Carolina \\u201c, and he is not exaggerating one bit. \\nIf what we are witnessing is truly the beginning of the fulfillment of what God showed John Paul Jackson, Terry Bennett and Patricia Green, then we should expect drought conditions to continue to intensify in the months ahead. \\nAnd as you can see above, they are saying that things will eventually get so bad that famine will strike America. \\nMost of us couldn\\u2019t imagine something like that ever happening in this nation. But these are men and women of God with very long track records. As I noted above, Dr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories by Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and John Paul Jackson has a track record of correctly fulfilled prophecies that is exceedingly long. \\nAs I end this article, I also want to remind everyone of what God showed Heidi Baker regarding the future of America not too long ago \\u2026 \\nI saw bread lines, soup kitchens, and I saw people wearing beautiful clothing. Their clothing was not worn out. Now in my nation when people are hungry you can tell. I mean they are in shredded rags. They don\\u2019t have shoes or they have flip flops. Most of them [have] no shoes. They are hungry and they know they are hungry. They come for food, not because they are beggars, but because they are hungry. \\nThese days a lot of Americans have become complacent and are feeling pretty good about things. \\nBut the events that are warned about in this article are coming, and I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can.\",\n          \"Two migrants have been given sentences of three and     years for beating a young man almost to death before violently raping his female friend. The government will try to deport only one of them, temporarily. [The Freie Zeiten reports that three teenage girls and one male friend met for a party at an apartment in Kista, near Stockholm, citing Solna District Court documents.  One of the girls invited a    migrant from Liberia, Richelieu Jarara, with whom she was acquainted. This man brought another African migrant, a Kenyan named Fayed Mwangi, with him. Before long, the migrants began sexually harassing the girls. Matters quickly escalated from there, with the pair conferring briefly before spraying their friend in the face with pepper spray. The Freie Zeiten describes how they then beat and kicked the man with \\u201cbrutal force\\u201d  leaving him with \\u201cmultiple cerebral haemorrhages, severe swelling and bruises all over his body, as well as bone fractures and open wounds\\u201d. The three girls, as well as the attackers, thought the young man had been beaten to death, with Jarara actually uploading a video to Snapchat in which he made light of having \\u201ckilled a guy\\u201d. He was, in fact, still alive, but unconscious and permanently brain damaged. Jarara\\u2019s younger companion,    Mwangi, is said to have \\u201cstrangled\\u201d one of the girls when she tried to intervene, slamming her into a wall and \\u201churling\\u201d her to the floor. The Kenyan then grabbed another of the girls by the hair, dragged her into the bedroom and raped her. She was also strangled, with the Kenyan threatening to strike her if she screamed. The ordeal was finally brought to an end when a neighbour burst into the apartment, allowing the girls to flee. According to the Fria Tider, the court sentenced Mwangi to just     years for his crimes, despite his having raped another woman in May 2016. The government will attempt to deport him afterwards  \\u2014   although he will be allowed to return to the country after ten years, and judges have prevented other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, from following through on deporting criminal migrants after their sentences in the past. Jarara, who has a string of previous convictions for crimes including theft, serious bodily injury, and resisting arrest, was given a slightly longer sentence  \\u2014   three years  \\u2014   but he will not be deported.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18241,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jenna Leigh Richardson Islamic State Supporting Former National Guardsman Pleads Guilty to Terrorism Charge in Virginia Former National Guardsman turned Islamic State sympathizer Mohamed Jalloh of Sterling, Virginia pled to guilty in federal court Thursday to a terrorism charge related to a July arrested during an FBI sting operation.\\nJalloh, a 27 year old naturalized citizen from Sierra Leone was arrested on July 3rd as part of an FBI counterterrorism operation in which he had communicated to a federal informant that he was interested in participating in a \\u201cFort Hood \\u201d style attack.\\nJalloh was apprehended by federal agents after purchasing a Stag Arms rifle at a Virginia arms dealer that had been rendered inoperable as part of the operation.\\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s office , authorities discovered during their operation that Jalloh was attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State by \\u201cassisting in the procurement of weapons\\u201d to be used in an attack on U.S. soil.\\nFollowing his arrest, Jalloh admitted to traveling to Africa to join the Islamic State, adding that he had quit the National Guard after listening to online lectures from deceased al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Aulaqi.\\nVia Justice.Gov \\n\\u2026in March 2016, a now-deceased member of ISIL brokered an introduction between Jalloh, 26, of Sterling, Virginia, and an individual in the United States who actually was an FBI confidential human source (CHS).

Jalloh praised the gunman who killed five U.S. military members in a terrorist attack in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July 2015, and stated that he had been thinking about conducting an attack similar to the November 2009 attack at Ft. Hood, Texas.\\nDuring the May 2016 meeting, Jalloh asked the CHS about the timeline for an operation and commented that it was better to plan an operation for the month of Ramadan. Jalloh also asked if the CHS could assist him in providing a donation to ISIL. Ultimately, Jalloh provided a prepaid cash transfer of $500 to a contact of the CHS that Jalloh believed was a member of ISIL, but who was in fact an undercover FBI employee.\\nDuring federal court Thursday Jalloh\\u2019s attorney , Joe Flood, stated that the defense plans to \\u201c provide context \\u201d during a February sentencing hearing in an effort to explain the defendant\\u2019s actions and what lead to his decisions.\\nJalloh currently faces up to 20 years in federal prison.\\n\",\n          \"Elaine Glusac How \\u2018Brexit\\u2019 Will Affect Travel to Europe - The New York Times In the height of the summer travel season, Britain voted to exit the European Union, scrambling markets as well as the political picture. What happens in the aftermath of \\u201cBrexit,\\u201d as it is known, is far from clear, but American travelers heading abroad will see some immediate effects. How does the Brexit vote affect Americans traveling to Europe and Britain? The most immediate effect is in the exchange rates between the dollar and the British pound, which has recorded its lowest rate in about 30 years after the results of the vote were published, providing American travelers a discount on prices paid throughout Britain. \\u201cSince yesterday, you get a lot more bang for your buck in the U. K.,\\u201d said Zach Honig, editor in chief at ThePointsGuy. com, which covers travel and incentives. \\u201cFor lots of people, London is traditionally an expensive tourist destination, and with this shift the U. K. and specifically London probably are now within reach for a lot of U. S.  travelers. \\u201d The dollar has also improved against the euro, making travel within countries using the euro cheaper. Is it a good time to book air travel? Yes, but it has been so for the last six weeks, according to George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog. com. \\u201cAirfares to Europe have been plummeting, especially for late summer travel, after the college kids go back to school around Aug. 28 and onward,\\u201d he said, noting that fares to Europe from the United States were appearing as low as $400 and $500    . \\u201cIt may have been an anticipation of Brexit, but we don\\u2019t know,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s probably also the fact that the euro and the pound were drifting lower, and that means that fewer people were flying from Europe to the U. S. and the airlines had to fill those seats with people flying from the U. S. to Europe. \\u201d Two to three years ago, he said summer airfares to Europe were running in the $1, 800 range. Current deals, said Gary Leff, the author of the travel blog Viewfromthewing. com, are \\u201ca function of some growth in capacity and some of the    seats on carriers like Norwegian. And it\\u2019s what we all expected, with some lag, due to lower fuel prices. It\\u2019s been inexpensive, and now it\\u2019s inexpensive to be there, thanks to the currency. \\u201d Will I get a better deal on a tour or package to Europe or Britain now? Maybe. It\\u2019s early days, but if exchange rates hold and travel softens within Europe and Britain, expect more enticing travel offers. \\u201cUsually when these things happen, the travel industry response is to bring people in,\\u201d said Mike Stitt, the North American president of Travelzoo, a publisher of travel deals. \\u201cThe real area I would watch for are vacation deals. There are packaging companies and tour operators who work with airlines and hotels and can put together strong deals to entice U. S. travelers. \\u201d When these deals might surface is unknown but probably later this year, assuming exchange rates hold. Will my experience at the U. K. or European borders change as a result of Brexit? No. Americans must still present a valid passport when entering European   countries as well as Britain. When the dust settles and Britain is extracted from the European Union, which most believe will take some years, it is travelers from European and U. K. countries who may experience more hassles at foreign borders. One area of uncertainty is Northern Ireland. A member of the U. K. Northern Ireland shares a   border with the Republic of Ireland now. No passports are required for transit between the two countries, which, though both were members of the European Union, use different currencies. With Britain\\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, the Ireland and Northern Ireland border would now represent a frontier between the U. K. and the European Union, though what form that would take is unknown. As Ireland\\u2019s Prime Minister Enda Kenny wrote in The Guardian this week, \\u201cWhat is not easy to quantify and mitigate is the psychological effect of a hardening border on the island. My fear is that it would play into an old narrative  \\u2014   one of division, isolation and difference. \\u201d Will there be any effects felt in the travel industry in the United States? That\\u2019s another unknown, but the decline of the pound relative to the dollar could affect incoming visitors from Britain who tend to visit popular destinations like New York, Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago. \\u201cIf British tourists, because of currency fluctuations, change their plans or don\\u2019t come to U. S. you may see some ability to get some better prices in some cities,\\u201d said Mr. Stitt of Travelzoo. \\u201cWe\\u2019re seeing a little of that effect now with the Canadian travelers. As their currency has plummeted against the dollar, Canadians are staying home. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton’s email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn’t hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. \\nAs we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \\n— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \\nOf course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”–which we now know to be Anthony Weiner’s sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn’t matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins–at least two years’ worth, and possibly an entire term’s worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him–resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. \\nBut according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz’ sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn’t even know about Comey’s letter at the time–and only found out when they checked Twitter. “Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn’t receive Comey’s letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn’ receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” \\nSo let’s see if we’ve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. \\nThere has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. \\nWhat it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn’t even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn’t trample on basic standards of fairness, I don’t know what does. \\nGranted, it’s not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz’ planned fishing expedition. But that doesn’t mean we can’t turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World. About Darrell Lucus \\nDarrell is a 30-something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school. An attempt to turn him into a member of the religious right in college only succeeded in turning him into the religious right\\'s worst nightmare--a charismatic Christian who is an unapologetic liberal. His desire to stand up for those who have been scared into silence only increased when he survived an abusive three-year marriage. You may know him on Daily Kos as Christian Dem in NC .

vendevamo titoli del tesoro degli stati uniti per miliardi di dollari secondo l ultimo aggiornamento dei dati ufficiali pubblicato da pochi giorni dal punto di vista generale gli investimenti globali nel debito pubblico degli stati uniti sono al livello minimo dal luglio chiaramente il ruolo del dollaro valuta di riserva mondiale ancora messo discussione nel l ammiraglio michael mullen presidente del joint chief staff statunitense avvert che il debito era la principale minaccia alla sicurezza nazionale mio avviso non tanto l alto debito pubblico oltre miliardi ad ostacolare l economia degli stati uniti per washington di fondamentale importanza garantirsi un enorme flusso di risorse estere ogni giorno per coprire deficit gemelli commercio e bilancio cio per il dipartimento del tesoro questione di vita di morte vendere titoli di debito nel mondo e co finanziare le spese degli usa si ricordi che dal fallimento di lehman brother nel settembre bank china ha subito forti pressioni da ben bernanke allora presidente della federal reserve fed non vendere titoli del debito degli stati uniti un primo momento cinesi decisero di mantenere il dollaro tuttavia da allora per due volta la pboc evitava di acquistare altri titoli degli stati uniti e allo stesso tempo avviava un piano per diversificare le riserve valutarie pechino acquista oro maniera massiccia negli ultimi anni e lo stesso fa la banca centrale della russia nel secondo trimestre del le riserve auree della banca di cina hanno raggiunto le tonnellate contro le tonnellate registrate nell ultimo trimestre del la federazione russa ha aumentato le riserve auree di circa tonnellate tra dicembre e giugno chiudendo il secondo trimestre di quest anno con un totale di tonnellate di fronte ai brutali scossoni del dollaro fondamentale acquistare asset pi sicuri come l oro che tempo di grave instabilit finanziaria agisce da rifugio sicuro quindi la strategia di mosca e pechino nel vendere titoli del tesoro degli usa e comprare oro viene seguita da molti paesi come stimato dal fondo monetario internazionale fmi le riserve auree delle banche centrali nel mondo hanno gi raggiunto il massimo degli ultimi anni registrando ai primo di ottobre un volume di circa tonnellate la geopolitica fa la sua parte nel plasmare il nuovo ordine finanziario mondiale dopo l imposizione delle sanzioni economiche al cremlino partire dal il rapporto con la cina ha avuto grande rilevanza per russi da allora le due potenze hanno approfondito legami tutti settori dall economia e finanza alla cooperazione militare inoltre assicurando la fornitura di gas alla cina per prossimi tre decenni il presidente vladimir putin ha costruito con l omologo xi jinping una potente alleanza finanziaria che cerca di porre fine una volta per tutte al dominio della moneta statunitense attualmente gli idrocarburi che mosca vende pechino sono pagati yuan non dollari co la moneta del popolo renminbi cinese emerge gradualmente nel mercato mondiale degli idrocarburi con il commercio tra russia e cina paesi che mio parere guidano la costruzione del sistema monetario multipolare la grande novit che alla corsa per la dedollarizzazione dell economia globale si unita l arabia saudita paese per decenni fedele alleato della politica estera di washington sorprendentemente negli ultimi mesi riad sbarazzata di pi di miliardi di dollari investiti titoli del tesoro degli stati uniti divenendo insieme alla cina uno dei principali venditori di debito degli stati uniti peggiorare le cose il regno saudita si accanisce sempre pi con la casa bianca fine settembre il congresso degli stati uniti approvava l eliminazione del veto del presidente barack obama ad una legge che impediva negli usa di denunciare l arabia saudita tribunale per il presunto coinvolgimento negli attentati dell settembre insieme l organizzazione dei paesi esportatori del petrolio opec ha raggiunto un accordo storico con la russia per ridurre la produzione di petrolio e quindi promuovere l aumento dei prezzi e anche sorprendente che giusto oggi pechino abbia aperto allo scambio diretto tra yuan e riyal saudita attraverso il trading system foreign exchange della cina cfets nell acronimo inglese per le transazioni tra le due valute senza passare dal dollaro di conseguenza molto probabile che pi prima che poi la compagnia petrolifera saudi aramco accetti
